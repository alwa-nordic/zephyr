 ACT I: The Deceptive Broadcast

    [Enter BOB]

    BOB:
      With Resolvable Private Address doth I make known mine presence,
      The scent of which EVE doth secretly collect.

    [Exit BOB, Enter ALICE]

    ALICE:
      In tranquil silence, a connection with BOB I do establish,
      And thus two souls become one, a bond born of unknown affection.

    [Enter BOB]

    BOB:
      I inscribe my deepest sentiments on this CCC,
      Pouring the ink of my thoughts onto this lifeless parchment.

    [Exit ALICE]

 ACT II: The Impersonation

    [Enter EVE]

    EVE:
      Clad in BOB's familiar facade, I announce myself,
      Deceptive in intent and form, the innocent ALICE I lure.

    ALICE:
      Upon EVE, with BOB's deceptive disguise, I confer mine trust,
      Into BOB's CCC, EVE scrawls, spreading her web of deceit.

    [Exit ALICE]

 ACT III: The Revelation

    [Enter BOB]

    BOB:
      In the fashion of old, mine name I declare once more,
      And, as if led by destiny's call, ALICE steps forth.

    ALICE:
      Unto BOB mine loyalty I submit once more,
      A connection, born anew from the ashes of the old.

    BOB:
      Upon the CCC, mine eyes do fall,
      Desiring strongly a confirmation of truth, I do seek value of one.

    BOB:
      But alas! The bitter taste of deceit, value null it stands.
